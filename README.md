## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 2. Setup MySQL Database
-- Open MySQL Workbench or any MySQL client
CREATE DATABASE marketplace;
USE marketplace;

-- Execute the SQL scripts:
-- schema.sql creates tables, constraints, and procedures
-- sample_data.sql populates initial data

### 3. Configure Database Connection
Database credentials are stored in db.py:

# db.py
DB_HOST = "localhost"
DB_USER = "root"
DB_PASSWORD = "your_password"
DB_NAME = "marketplace"

def get_connection():
    import mysql.connector
    return mysql.connector.connect(
        host=DB_HOST,
        user=DB_USER,
        password=DB_PASSWORD,
        database=DB_NAME
    )

### 4. Run the Application
python backend/app.py
